## Plotting Assignment 1 for Exploratory Data Analysis

In my code, plots are created by using file device. So, each plot does not appear on the screen device </br>
as a pop-up and is directly saved as a png file in the working directory. According to the instruction for </br>
evaluation, we are not required to run the code. However, in case you run the code, please look for </br>
each png file somewhere in your working directory. Thanks for reading.
