## Project for Exploratory Data Analysis Course

In my code, plots are created by using file device. So, each plot does not appear on the screen device as a pop-up, </br>
but is directly saved as a png file in the working directory.  When running my code, if you see "null device 1" at the end,
please look for each png file somewhere in your working directory.
