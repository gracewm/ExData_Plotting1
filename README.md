## Project for Exploratory Data Analysis Course

In my code, plots are created by using file device. So, each plot does not appear on the screen device 
as a pop-up, but is directly saved as a png file in the working directory. According to the instruction 
for evaluation, we are not required to run the code. However, in case you run the code, please look for 
each png file somewhere in your working directory.
