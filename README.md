## Project for Exploratory Data Analysis Course

In my code, plots are created by using file device. So, each plot does not appear on the screen device </br> 
as a pop-up, but is directly saved as a png file in the working directory. According to the instruction </br>
for evaluation, we are not required to run the code. However, in case you run the code, please look for </br>
each png file somewhere in your working directory.
