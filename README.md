## Project for Exploratory Data Analysis Course

In my code, plots are created by using file device. So, each plot does not appear on the screen device </br>
as a pop-up, but is directly saved as a png file in the working directory.  When running my code, </br>
if the execution stops at "dev.off()", please hit enter key, and you will see "null device 1" at the end. </br>
Then, please look for each png file somewhere in your working directory.
